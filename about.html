      This web app is intended to help you keep "in tune".<br>
      It works by detecting and displaying your voice pitch - you should try to keep your voice at the pitch you intended. To help you, you can sing along to a scale.<br><br>
      You have two on/off buttons on the left:<br>
      <b>start/stop voice</b> - shows the pitch (note) of your voice<br>
      <b>start/stop scale</b> - shows the note as a scale is played.<br><br>
      
      You can set your <b>Vocal range</b> in the next box on the right. The vocal range will also define the scale that you can sing along to.<br>
      For example, if you set  the "contralto" range, which covers the 2 octaves from F3 to F5 (by the way, middle C is called C4) then the scale will be F major. <br><br>
      
      You can change the <b>scale</b> in the next box, using some sliders:
      <br>The top slider changes the <b>tempo</b> (beats per minute).
      <br>The second slider changes the <b>note length</b> (between a quarter note and a full note).
      <br>The last slider changes the number of <b>octaves</b> of the scale - either the lower, or the upper, or both octaves.
